NISC provided raw fastq files generated with Illumina bcl2fastq (?). The fastq files were processed through the 10X CellRanger platform (7.0.1) using the “refdata-gex-mm10-2020-A” reference to generate count matrices. These were then imported into R (version 4.1) with scran::read10xCounts. Percent mitochondrial reads were calculated with scater:: perCellQCMetrics and outliers were removed. The counts were log normalized and 1000 (?) highly variable genes were selected with scran:: getTopHVGs for the downstream PCA calculation (using 20 (?) top principal components). The PCA reduced dimensions were used as input for scran’s UMAP visualization and clustering tools.
